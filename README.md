ðŸ“Š DSA Visualization Tool: Merge Sort
This project is a Full Stack Fresher Demonstration focusing on core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) principles implemented within a modern web application structure. It provides a visual, step-by-step animation of the Merge Sort algorithm.

It's designed to showcase proficiency across the entire development stack, specifically emphasizing strong Python-centric backend logic and responsive front-end development, making it highly relevant for a Full Stack Developer role.

ðŸš€ Key Features & Stack
Core Technology Stack
Back-end Logic (Simulated): Python (Conceptual, using Merge Sort algorithm structure)
Front-end: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (for aesthetics and responsiveness), Vanilla JavaScript
Algorithm: Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)
